# macOS - Keychain

### Statement
https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Forensic/macOS-Keychain

### Solution
1. Download the ch26.zip package and extract it, you'll find a file with the .img extension.

2. Challenge says the ch26.img file is a disc image of a MAC hard drive, hence the file system type should be HFS+ most probably, you can then mount the ch26.img file like follows:
```
amemni:~$ sudo mount -t hfsplus -o loop ch26.img /mnt/
```

3. Explore the mounted MAC disc image, you'll find a couple of interesting files and folders:
```
amemni:/mnt$ ls
Applications  dev  home       Library  Network  sbin  Users  Volumes
cores         etc  kcpass.py  net      private  tmp   usr
``` 

4. As a start, check the /etc/kcpasswd, it's from the OSX autologin enabler utility and contains a copy of the OSX session password which is merely encoded with an XOR cipher. You can decode that yourself, by first reading about it then writing a simple python script, or use the following tool from [jjarava/mac-osx-forensics](https://github.com/jjarava/mac-osx-forensics):
```
amemni:/mnt$ python kcpass.py $(xxd -p ./etc/kcpassword)

    Kcpasswd: 0x1bb92010bccfec89c0d52b0bb86123b57ab499f2465591a0.
    Magic Xor: 0x7d895223d2bcddeaa3b91f.
    Used Magic Xor: 0x7d895223d2bcddeaa3b91f7d895223d2bcddeaa3b91f7d895223d2bcddeaa3b91f.

    The password is: "f0r*****v13".
```

5. After the OSX session password is recovered, it's then easier to extract the Gmail password from the user's Keychain that's available under the following link: `Users/t3rr0r1st3/Library/Keychains/login.keychain-db`  
For me, I honestly copied the login.keychain-db in a MAC machine and opened it with the usual Keychain Access program. However, there should defenitely be a couple of keychain breaker tools out there that do the job like this [n0fate/chainbreaker](https://github.com/n0fate/chainbreaker), feel free to explore that.

6. Simply concatenate the OSX session password and the Gmail password together and submit its SHA256 as a flag:
```
amemni:/mnt$ echo -n "f0r******89" |sha256sum 
9e17******************7ac  -
```
