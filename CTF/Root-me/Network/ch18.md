### Solution
1. Challenge description and related resources give a hint that the ch18.bin is in the BTSnoop file format, one can also see that by printing the first 8 octets by corresponding to the Identification pattern from the File header:
```
amemni:~/Desktop/CTF/Root-me/Network$ xxd -l16 ch18.bin
00000000: 6274 736e 6f6f 7000 0000 0001 0000 03ea  btsnoop.........
```

2. Also, similarly one can see that the 4 octets for the Datalink type show the value 1002 correspond to `HCI UART (H4) 1002`. You can then use the (hcidump)[https://linux.die.net/man/8/hcidump] tool to parse the data and get both the Mac address and the device name, you can also use Wireshark, or even the strings command for printing the device name:
```
amemni:~/Desktop/CTF/Root-me/Network$ hcidump -r ch18.bin |grep -m1 bdaddr
    bdaddr 0C:**:**:**:**:C6 class 0x5a020c type ACL
amemni:~/Desktop/CTF/Root-me/Network$ strings ch18.bin 
btsnoop
GT-****
GT-****
```

3. Simply concatenate the MAC address and the device name together and submit its SHA1 as a flag:
```
amemni@amemni-HP-15-Notebook-PC:~/Desktop/CTF/Root-me/Network$ echo -n "0C:**:**:**:**:C6GT-****" |sha1sum 
c1d0******************22b  -
```
