- Centralization is why domains are important (managing all clients centrally), in addition to security.
- `GPO`: Group Policy Object, a virtual collection of policy objects.
- `LDAP` vs `Kerberos`: Kerberos is the authentication protocol whereas LDAP is for AD domains central info.
- `RAS`: Remote Access Server, the MS way of a VPN.
- `DMZ`: Demilitarized Zone.
- `SCCM`: System Center Configuration Manager, is used to control all devices centrally, now called `Endpoint CM`.
- Virtualization came with VmWare early 2000, whereas Hypervisors were there in 1970s !!
- `Hyper-V` is the MS virtualization solution. Checkpoints in Hyper-V are like snapshots.
- `IAAS` / `SAAS` & `PAAS` are translatate to Azure / Microsoft 365  in the MS Cloud Services world
- `AzureAD` is the directory service and is different that ADDS (is more web-based)
