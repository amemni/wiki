## Introduction

- A foundation of AD domains, RAS, DMZ and virtualization, and MS Azure:

- Centralization is why domains are important (managing all clients centrally), in addition to security.
- `GPO`: Group Policy Object, a virtual collection of policy objects.
- `LDAP` vs `Kerberos`: Kerberos is the authentication protocol whereas LDAP is for AD domains central info.
- `RAS`: Remote Access Server, the MS way of a VPN.
- `DMZ`: Demilitarized Zone.
- `SCCM`: System Center Configuration Manager, is used to control all devices centrally, now called `Endpoint CM`.
- Virtualization came with VmWare early 2000, whereas Hypervisors were there in 1970s !!
- `Hyper-V` is the MS virtualization solution. Checkpoints in Hyper-V are like snapshots.
- `IAAS` / `SAAS` & `PAAS` are translatate to Azure / Microsoft 365  in the MS Cloud Services world
- `AzureAD` is the directory service and is different that ADDS (is more web-based)

- Download a Windows Server 2019 Trial ISO - Enterprise: <https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-windows-server-2019.html>

- Create a Virtual Switch in Hyper-V of type "External". You might face this issue on Windows 10: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/746205/hyper-v-not-able-to-add-new-virtual-switch

- Create a Virtual Machine in Hyper-V called Windows 10, you can do so by clicking on "New" > "Virtual Machine" then following the instructions on the wizard:

- Notes:

  - If asked, make sure to set the OS to "Windows 10 Enterprise".
  - When prompted for a MS email address, you can put anyone (not a MS one) to create a local account instead.
  - When the new Virtual Machine boots up, go to "Control Panel" > "System" > "Advanced System and Settings" > "Computer Name" and click on "Change" to change the Virtual Machine name:
