- Section 2 | Number theory lectures that might help
  - Introduction to congruences:

  ```matlab
  a ≡ b (mod n) iff n | (a - b)
  ```

  - Equivalence classes:

  ```matlab
  S := { a - nq | q ∈ ZZ } = [a]

  Let c ∈ ZZ, let a ≡ b (mod n)
  a + c ≡ b + c (mod n)
  a * c ≡ b * c (mod n)
  ```

  - Introduction to linear congruences:

  ```matlab
  Let c ∈ ZZ, let a ≡ b (mod n)

  a * c ≡ b * c (mod n) => a ≡ b (mod n / (c, n))
  ```
